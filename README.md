Most of the required packages are in requirements.txt

You can prepare environments with the requirements.txt file in the repository directory.
```sh
pip install requirements.txt
```
### Equipment preparation

1. A computer to play speckle patterns and calculate results.

2. A USB [Webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam) to simple.


## 2. Running the system

You can launch the graphical interface by running main.py

## 3. Conducting a demonstration

1. Click the adjustment button to adjust the camera position according to the display screen, so that the speckle pattern is exactly within the camera's shooting range.
